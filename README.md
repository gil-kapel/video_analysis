Example Workflow:
  1. User Input:
     - User enters a query in English related to a specific topic.

  2. Video Search:
     - Use YouTube API to search for relevant videos in Persian.
     - Store the metadata and video links.

  3. Query Processing:
     - Use NLP techniques to understand the user query.
     - Analyze the transcriptions to find the best match.

  4. Video Analysis:
     - Create a contextual understanding and a relevance score for each video according to the query

  5. Result Delivery:
     - Display the video name, timestamp, and relevant text snippet to the user.


Video Analysis Components:

1. Metadata Analysis
2. Text Analysis (Transcriptions)
3. Visual Analysis (Optional but useful)
4. Speech Analysis
5. Contextual Understanding
6. Relevance Scoring

Detailed Breakdown:

1. Metadata Analysis

- Objective: Extract and analyze video metadata to understand the context and relevance.
- Steps:
  - Extract metadata such as title, description, tags, and comments.
  - Use NLP techniques to analyze the metadata for keywords and context related to the users query.
  - Score the metadata based on relevance to the topic.


2. Text Analysis (Transcriptions)

- Objective: Analyze the textual content of the video obtained from speech-to-text transcriptions.
- Steps:
  - Tokenize and preprocess the transcribed text (e.g., remove stop words, stemming/lemmatization).
  - Use NLP models to understand the context and semantics.
  - Apply topic modeling techniques (e.g., LDA) to identify the main topics discussed in the video.
  - Use sentiment analysis to gauge the tone and sentiment of the content if relevant.


3. Visual Analysis (Optional but Useful)

- Objective: Analyze the visual content of the video to gain additional context.
- Tools: OpenCV, Google Cloud Vision API, or custom deep learning models
- Steps:
  - Extract key frames from the video.
  - Use image recognition techniques to identify objects, scenes, and text within the frames.
  - Analyze visual elements to determine the context and relevance to the users query (e.g., identifying text in slides or relevant objects).


4. Speech-to-Text (for Video Content)

- Objective: Convert spoken Persian in videos to text for analysis.
- Tools: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Mozilla DeepSpeech, or other Persian-compatible STT services
- Steps:
  - Extract audio from video files.
  - Use a speech-to-text service to transcribe the audio into text.
  - Store the transcriptions along with timestamps for each segment.


5. Contextual Understanding

- Objective: Combine text, metadata, and visual analysis to build a comprehensive understanding of the video content.
- Steps:
  - Merge insights from metadata, text, visual and speech analysis.
  - Use contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to understand the relationship between different parts of the video.
  - Create a structured representation of the video content (e.g., segments or chapters).


6. Relevance Scoring

- Objective: Score each video (or segment within the video) based on its relevance to the userâ€™s query.
- Steps:
  - Develop a scoring algorithm that considers all content types.
  - Rank videos or segments based on their relevance score.
  - Highlight the most relevant parts of the video, including timestamps.


Example Workflow for Video Analysis:
1. Extract Metadata:
   - Use YouTube API to get video metadata.
   - Analyze metadata for keywords related to the user query.

2. Transcribe Video:
   - Extract audio and convert to text using speech-to-text services.
   - Store transcriptions with timestamps.

3. Analyze Transcriptions:
   - Preprocess the text.
   - Apply NLP techniques to understand context and semantics.
   - Identify key topics and sentiments.

4. Optional Visual Analysis:
   - Extract key frames from the video.
   - Analyze images for relevant objects, scenes, and text.

5. Contextual Understanding:
   - Combine insights from metadata, text, and visual analysis.
   - Create a structured representation of the video content.

6. Relevance Scoring:
   - Score each video or segment based on relevance to the user query.
   - Highlight relevant timestamps and text snippets.
